# --- Collector connection architecture axes -----------------------------------
# Three independent, explicit per-entry axes replace the old habit of inferring
# transport ownership and endpoint control from operation mode, endpoint
# hostname, peer IP, or collector type. See
# ``connection/connection_policy.py`` for the single source of truth and the
# migration mapping from the legacy fields.

# 1) connection_strategy: how Home Assistant obtains the collector TCP session.
CONF_CONNECTION_STRATEGY = "connection_strategy"
# The collector already dials Home Assistant by itself; runtime only claims or
# waits for the inbound session. It must never send a UDP callback probe, ask
# the collector to reconnect, or rewrite the endpoint for connection recovery.
CONNECTION_STRATEGY_INBOUND = "inbound"
# Home Assistant must ask the collector to dial back (UDP callback trigger) per
# explicit connection attempt, then claim the resulting inbound session.
CONNECTION_STRATEGY_CALLBACK_ON_DEMAND = "callback_on_demand"

	CONNECTION_STRATEGY_INBOUND,
	CONNECTION_STRATEGY_CALLBACK_ON_DEMAND,
}
# Safe default: assume the collector is already connected and do not touch the
# wire on its behalf. Migration promotes cloud-primary entries to callback.
DEFAULT_CONNECTION_STRATEGY = CONNECTION_STRATEGY_INBOUND
# Diagnostic provenance for HOW the persisted connection_strategy was decided:
# behaviorally verified inbound (restart -> genuine collector dial-in with no
# callback trigger) or a verified one-shot callback attempt. Shared const layer
# so the connection policy and the onboarding verification agree on the values
# without importing each other. Never consulted for transport decisions.
CONF_CONNECTION_STRATEGY_EVIDENCE = "connection_strategy_evidence"
# The collector was restarted and dialed back in on its own, with NO callback
# trigger sent. This is the only genuine behavioral proof of `inbound`, and it
# may ONLY be recorded by the restart/reconnect verification that actually
# performed it. Never reuse it for a value the user merely asserted or picked.
# NOTE: this legacy evidence value is NOT a RecoveryContract inbound proof by
# itself -- <=v4 schemas stored neither a verification timestamp nor a strong
# identity source, so it cannot be backfilled and the contract model has no
# legacy method to backfill into (see connection/recovery_contract.py; the
# v4->v5 migration is a pure version bump, pinned by the migration tests).
CONNECTION_STRATEGY_EVIDENCE_REBOOT_RECONNECT = "reboot_reconnect"
# LEGACY COMPATIBILITY VALUE. Historical bookkeeping: "a one-shot UDP callback
# trigger was answered on a NEW session once, during onboarding". That was an
# IDENTITY observation, never a recovery proof -- it says nothing about
# re-establishing contact after the session is lost, and it never becomes a
# RecoveryContract callback proof (connection/recovery_contract.py rejects it
# by rule). New production writers MUST NOT create this value; it exists only
# so the legacy strategy READER (connection_policy) keeps resolving entries
# that already carry it. Removal is a separate cleanup phase.
CONNECTION_STRATEGY_EVIDENCE_CALLBACK_TRIGGER = "callback_trigger"
# The user explicitly picked an observed, unclaimed strong-PN session and bound
# it to a waiting entry. That is honest provenance for `inbound` (the collector
# demonstrably dials in) but it is NOT a restart/reconnect proof -- nothing was
# restarted and nothing was triggered -- and it never becomes a RecoveryContract
# inbound proof.
